# postman-website
## Description
This is the website i'm creating for postman <br>
I'm in contact with postman's owner and he agree with this. <br>
## How to edit this
so,
- If you want to add new version, update the version.js 
- If you want to add new modules/update, update modules.js
- If you want to add a new player to the dev list, you have to:<br>
a) Edit 3dskin.html, insert the name of the player you want to add on the iframe<br>
b) Open 3dskin.html, record the player moving (you can rotate it if you want)<br>
c) Cut the video so that it seems like a gif, but keep the extension to .mp4<br>
d) Update playerDev.js, with the first 3 numbers you can choose where the guy will be displayed
